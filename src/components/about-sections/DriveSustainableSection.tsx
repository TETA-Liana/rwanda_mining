          Local mineral supply chains play a multifaceted role in shaping our world. Their impact extends beyond mere economic gain, and serves as the backbone for safe and responsible socio-economic development. By harnessing and managing mineral resources within their own regions, communities can cultivate self-sufficiency, create jobs, and build resilient economies.
          <br /><br />
          However, their significance transcends local boundaries. These supply chains are intrinsically connected to the global economy, tapping into insatiable worldwide demand for minerals. This international demand is especially significant for critical minerals, which are indispensable for cutting-edge technologies and pivotal to addressing environmental challenges.

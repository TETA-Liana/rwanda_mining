                Since 2022, we have partnered with innovative exhibition stand builders, Jane&Paul, who specialise in creating sustainable exhibition infrastructure.
                <br/><br/>
                Their flat-pack and modular designs boast a low carbon footprint in both transportation and packaging, allowing for reuse at each show. The primary construction material used is sustainably sourced South African Pine, known for its natural durability and ability to store carbon, making it an ideal choice for reducing environmental impact in the construction industry. Employing a CNC cut joining mechanism ensures precise assembly, eliminates the need for standard fasteners like screws or nails, and facilitates efficient flat-packing and reusability of the units.

                Along with adopting ScanDisplay‚Äôs fabric shell scheme solution for stands, we also selected lightweight panels that, in keeping with our sustainable practices, lower carbon emissions and improve transport convenience. Following the event, exhibitors can store their graphic walls with ScanDisplay for reuse, promoting resource conservation, waste reduction, and furthering our sustainability objectives. The sustainable approach to improving our exhibition includes the use of reusable carpet tiles, significantly reducing waste compared to traditional single-use carpets typically found at exhibitions. By integrating digital screens and signage throughout the event space, we also lessened the dependence on freestanding banners, strengthening our sustainability efforts.
